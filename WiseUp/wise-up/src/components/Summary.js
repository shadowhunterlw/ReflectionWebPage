          We are in critical times- now more than ever. It is easier for individuals to slack off thanks to technology. We have apps like Netflix, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, Disney plus, Fortnite: all portable via phone, and the list continues on. All these apps are great and make a lot of money. But what if we change our focus on apps that would develop the best part of each of us. Like a productivity app that can expand the human mind like never before, by making studying enjoyable. ENJOYABLE. Yes, I said it.
